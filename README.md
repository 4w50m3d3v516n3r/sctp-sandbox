# sctp-sandbox
This project contains a very simple SCTP client/server application, used for testing purposes. It is written mainly in C. I use it to generate some traffic over an SCTP association.

WARNING!!!

Please note that this code is for testing purposes only! It is not meant to be production ready and I do advise not to use it in real-life projects without adding proper error handling!
